This is `iniestat`. A package intended to ease statistics for a data analyst, as Andrès used to ease the ball for his teammates. First developments have been made in collaboration with Montpellier Hérault S. C. (MHSC) and I am thankful to this club.

## Installation

Still in development and not yet published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), to install `iniestat` you first need to install the [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) package if you don't have it yet.

```r 
# Install devtools from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
```

Then, you can download and install the package with

```r
devtools::install_github("rchailan/iniestat")
```

Once done, enjoy the package with

```r
library(iniestat)
```

## Usage

Check out the `Articles` section for details. General usage is described in the [Vignette](https://rchailan.github.io/iniestat/articles/iniestat-vignette.html).
